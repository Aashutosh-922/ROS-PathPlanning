# ROS-PathPlanning
# Drone Automation with ROS (Robot Operating System)

## Overview

This project focuses on achieving proficiency in Drone Automation through ROS (Robot Operating System), enabling wireless manipulation of drones. The primary goal is to implement automation for surveillance tasks using image processing techniques and integrate data uploading to GIS (Geographic Information Systems) systems.

## Features

- **ROS Integration**: Leverages the capabilities of ROS for seamless communication and coordination between various components of the drone system.

- **Wireless Drone Manipulation**: Enables wireless control and manipulation of drones through ROS, allowing for efficient and flexible operations.

- **Image Processing Techniques**: Implements advanced image processing techniques to enhance the drone's surveillance capabilities. This includes tasks such as object detection, tracking, and scene analysis.

- **GIS Integration**: Integrates with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to upload and analyze data collected during drone operations. This enhances the spatial awareness and mapping capabilities of the drone.

## Dependencies

- ROS (Melodic or newer)
- Python
- OpenCV
- GIS library (dependent on the chosen GIS system)

## Installation

1. Install ROS on your system by following the official ROS installation guide: [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)

2. Set up a ROS workspace for this project:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/your-username/drone-automation-ros.git
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

4. Install the GIS library based on the chosen GIS system (e.g., GeoPandas for integrating with QGIS).

## Usage

1. Launch the ROS environment:

```bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
roscore
```

2. Run the drone automation nodes:

```bash
roslaunch drone_automation surveillance.launch
```

3. Monitor the drone's operations and surveillance activities.

## GIS Integration

Ensure that you have the necessary GIS libraries installed based on the GIS system you are using. Update the GIS-related configurations in the project files accordingly.
